Entering the app takes you to the main page, which gives you the ability to add an assignment or add a course. It also informs you of the current weather, and the next assignment that is due. If you would like to add an assignment, press the button labeled "Add Due Date", which takes you to a separate page with a drop down menu of classes, the importance of the assignment, and the due date. This assignment is saved to the calendar, which you can access from the main page. If you would like to add a course, press the button on the main page labeled "Add Course", which takes you to a seperate page that allows you to pick the start and end time, the name of the course, the multiplier (how important this class is to you), as well as the time and date of the lectures. Upon pressing done, this course will be added to your schedule automatically until the end date.
